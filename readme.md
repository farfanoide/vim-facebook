Installation:
-------------

Probably any plugin manager will work. Then set `colorscheme facebook` on your
vimrc.

With [vim-plug][vim-plug]:

```vim
Plug 'farfanoide/vim-facebook'
```

With [Vundle][vundle]:

```vim
Plugin 'farfanoide/vim-facebook'
```

With [dein][dein]:

```vim
call dein#add('farfanoide/vim-facebook')
```
